        <h2>GET TO KNOW ME</h2>
        <p>I was born and raised in the South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles where I grew to love this beautiful city. I graduated high school in 2015 and immedialty enrolled into Pasasdena City COllege where I spent two years and eventually transferred into UCLA where I graduated in 2020. After graduatation, however, I was lost on what I wanted to pursue as a career so I went to work for my parents as their deleivery driver. While there, I was able to meet extradotinary and hardworking individulas as well as learning a few things about the Garment Industry. But, I wasn't feeling fulfilled there so I made the choice to pursue a career as a web developer and although I am new to this field, it has been fun and rewarding.</p>
        <p>With that said, I'd like to point out some of my interests so you can have a more filled impression of me. Althoug I've grown up in a city, I enjoy going out of it and seeing the parks Los Angeles and California has to offer. Some of my favorite spots are Eaton Canyon and Joshua Tree. However, I'm also an introvert so I like to stay in sometimes and spend my time playing video games with the Elder Scrolls being my absolute favorite video game series. And although I am not good at it, I also like to skateboard around my neighborhood. That's a short description about me and so I'd like to thank you for your time in reading this section.</p>
