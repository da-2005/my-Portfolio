# my-Portfolio

## Technologies Used
So far the technoligies used are:
- HTML
- CSS
I am planning on adding JavaScript later on to make the site feel more dynamic. 

## Description
This is my portfolio of projects for interested employers:

- When an emplyer opens the portfolio, they are presented with my name, a picture or avatar, and links to my projects, an About Me section, and a Contact section.
- WHen a link is clicked from the navigation bar, the page redirects to that part of the webpage.
- The image of the first project should be larger in size that the rest of the project images.
- WHen the images are clicked, the employer should be redirected to the deployed project.
- Use media queries to resize the portfolio when viewed through different viewports.
